Here I am trying to creat a corona virus simulation. I will be attepting to make this as aquarate as possible by adding many different factors to get a realistic idea of how the virus spreads. 
Feel free to add your ideas to the code. 
Also make sure to take a look at the [Summary](https://github.com/rashad-h/Covid-Simulation/blob/master/Summary.pdf) if you are interested in the results gathered.
